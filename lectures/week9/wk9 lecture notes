--------
Anomoly Detection: (flags things because they stand out from the rest of the crowd)
applications, fraud detection, aircraft engines, monitoring data centre pc's

Identify outliers to do an action to  them, can you send them a marketing campaign?

Video 2
--------
gaussian distribution

Video 3
-------
p(x) = p(x1; mu1, sigma^2) * p(x2) * p(x3) *.... * P(x_n)

symbolised by the big product equation

see screen shot for anomoly detection algorithm

Video 4
--------
evaluating anomoly detection software

10,000 good engines and 
2-50 faulty

Splitting up data
---------------------
training set = 6000
CV = 2000 + 10 anomolies
TEST = 2000 + 10 anomolies

Evaluation Metrics
- compute precision/recall
- F1 score

Use CV set to choose epsilon

Video 5
-----------
When to use different sorts of algorithms

ANOMOLY DETECTION:
Used to predict unlikely events. 
i.e number of examples large, but number of anomolies is tiny.

SUPERVISED LEARNING:
large number of positive and negative examples


Anomoly detection can be used to detect a number of power plants playing up

-------
Choosing features for AnDetect
 
chose gaussian features - check using hist()
or transform the features with log(x) if the data is skewed. This usually makes it gaussian.

Menu of things you can do to make you data gaussian:
1. log(x)
2. log(x+C)
3. x^(1/2)
4. x^(1/3)


Make new derived features by doing x1/x2 or x1^2/x2 etc...

Video 7
----------
Multivariate Gaussian distb

all probs at the same time

the special multivariate

Video 8
-------
AnDet using Multi variate gaussian distbn

When to use:



Original Model
=================
1. requires manually creating strange combinations of features.

2. Computationally cheaper

3. works on small training sets


Multivariate Gaussian
=======================
1. Automattically captures correlations between features

2. computationaly expensive

3. must have m >> n

4. requires many more records than columns


non-invertible then make sure m >> n

Video 9
--------
Recommender Systems

some algorithms try and learn what are good features

Video 10
--------
Recommender systems

Ex.1 look at Carol
X = [1 ; 1.0 ; 0.01]
theta = [0 ; 0 ; 5]

theta' * X

Video 11
---------
Collaborative Filtering

X = [0;0.5]
theta1 = [0; 0]
theta2 = [0; 3]
theta3 = [0; 5]

theta1' * X
theta2' * X
theta3' * X

All the users will be helping each other to make better user predictions. you guess theta, then optimise X, then optimise theta for you new X and so on.
