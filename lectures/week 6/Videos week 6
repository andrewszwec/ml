Video 1
-------
1. get more training examples
2. smaller set of features
3. additional features if current set are not 4. descriptive enough
4. polynomial features
5. decreasing/increasing lamba

Technique for rule out things to pursue for learning algorithms

Machine LEarning Diagnostics:

Video 2
-------
split into 70% training, 30% test set
Order records randomly before splitting


Train a model then test it on a test set and get the test set error using J

If the error goes up with polynomial terms, dont use them, etc...

cross validation

Diagnosing Bias vs variance

Video 5
--------
Model selection applied to selecting model selectino parameter lambda

Video 6
--------
Learning Curves

artifically reduce training set size and see how the model fits the data. Plot training set size vs Error in fit.

Check your model is not suffering from high bias.
If it is no more data points are going to help improve the model performance.

High variance problems can be solved by getting more training data.
