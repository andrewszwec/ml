K Means algorithm
1. Cluster assignment step based on distance to centroid of red and blue group
2. Move the centroid based on the average x and y of the cluster (each red or blue cluster). and re-assign clusters based on distance to cluster centroid


How to choose K:



Video 3/4 - Optimisation Objective
------------------------------------

c(i) = the cluster index
mu_k = cluster of centroid K
mu_c(i) = centroid of cluster that i belongs to
