%  ------------
% 
%  This file contains code that helps you get started on the
%  exercise. You will need to complete the following functions:
%
%     gaussianKernel.m
%     dataset3Params.m
%     processEmail.m
%     emailFeatures.m
%
%  For this exercise, you will not need to change any code in this file,
%  or any other files other than those mentioned above.
%

%% Initialization
clear ; close all; clc


% Load from ex6data1: 
% You will have X, y in your environment
load('ex6data1.mat');


%% ==================== Part 2: Training Linear SVM ====================
%  The following code will train a linear SVM on the dataset and plot the
%  decision boundary learned.
%

% Load from ex6data1: 
% You will have X, y in your environment
load('ex6data1.mat');


%% =============== Part 3: Implementing Gaussian Kernel ===============
%  You will now implement the Gaussian kernel to use
%  with the SVM. You should complete the code in gaussianKernel.m
%

load('ex6data2.mat');

% SVM Parameters
C = 1; sigma = 0.1;

model= svmTrain(X, y, C, @(x1, x2) gaussianKernel(x1, x2, sigma)); 
visualizeBoundary(X, y, model);


% Load from ex6data3: 
% You will have X, y in your environment
load('ex6data3.mat');

%pause;

%% ========== Part 7: Training SVM with RBF Kernel (Dataset 3) ==========

%  This is a different dataset that you can use to experiment with. Try
%  different values of C and sigma here.
% 

% Load from ex6data3: 
% You will have X, y in your environment
load('ex6data3.mat');

% Try different SVM Parameters here
[C, sigma] = dataset3Params(X, y, Xval, yval);

% Turn on visualisation at end
vis = 1;

if (vis==1) 
	% Train the model
	model= svmTrain(X, y, C, @(x1, x2) gaussianKernel(x1, x2, sigma));
	% Lastly visualise the model
	visualizeBoundary(X, y, model);
